This program is a test of the algorithm I am developing to predict the 
semantic structure of an utterance incrementally during someone's speech 
utterance.

It is part of the research I am currently doing at the Tufts Human Robot
Interaction Lab. In the upcoming weeks, this will be implemented into DiARC, the
cognitive architecture that is developed and maintained by the lab.
