This program is a implements a bigram prediction algorithm I am developing to predict the 
textof an utterance incrementally during someone's speech.

A PDF of a poster I presented on this research can be found in the files above.

It is part of the research I am currently doing at the Tufts Human Robot
Interaction Lab. In the upcoming weeks, this will be implemented into DiARC, the
cognitive architecture that is developed and maintained by the lab.
